## Introduction

The "NewsHub" project was conceived with the aim of providing users with easy access to news from different sources in one convenient location. It was developed as a solo project over the course of a month, with weekly goals set to ensure progress. The goal was to cater to individuals who have varying levels of interest in keeping up with the news, providing them with a simple solution to stay informed while on the go.

## Future

While there's still room for improvement and updates of features that I would love to implement into NewsHub. Such as adding more NEWSAPIs and features to keep users motivated and engaged. Also, I intend to add authentication method for user verification.
