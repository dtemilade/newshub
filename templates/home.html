						<h2><u>Project</u></h2>
						<h3>This project started because I wanted to make it easy for people to read news from different places in one simple place.<br><br>I talked to a friend about how many people now get their news online.<br>We thought it would be helpful to create a website or app where you can find news from lots of different places easily.<br><br>My friend told me about APIs, which are tools that developers use to add features to websites.These APIs can help users stay updated with what's happening in the world.<br><br>"NewsHub" is a project that aims to meet the different needs and preferences of its users.<br><br>When the opportunity came to build the project as a Portfolio Project for <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com">Holberton School</a>, it became a challenge because my friend was busy with another project, so I had to work on it alone.<br><br>I had about a month to finish the project, with weekly goals to achieve.<br><br>It was tough to meet the deadlines and accomplish the plans.<br>I used resources from various places to build the project.<br><br>While there's still room for improvement and updates, I'm thankful that the project was successful.<br>Now you have NewsHub, designed to give you easy access to news at your fingertips.</h3>
